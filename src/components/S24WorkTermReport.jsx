            Goals & Reflections
          </h3>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-disc text-gray-600">
            <li>
              <strong>Goal 1:</strong> Lead the revamp of the company website to
              enhance user experience and functionality.
            </li>
            <p className="ml-6">
              <strong>Reflection:</strong> I successfully completed the website
              revamp using React.js, overcoming challenges in creating a
              multi-page web application for the first time. The new design
              resulted in increased user engagement, and I received positive
              feedback from both users and stakeholders.
            </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Goal 2:</strong> Improve database management by optimizing
              database structures to enhance performance.
            </li>
            <p className="ml-6">
              <strong>Reflection:</strong> Through my efforts, I reduced query
              times and transitioned the database to a more flexible structure.
              This significantly improved data management efficiency, making it
              easier to handle larger datasets and streamline operations.
            </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Goal 3:</strong> Develop innovative programs to automate
              business operations, focusing on payroll automation and route
              sequencing.
            </li>
            <p className="ml-6">
              <strong>Reflection:</strong> I automated several manual processes,
              including payroll and driver route assignments, saving time and
              reducing errors. The automation tools I created were highly
              praised for their usability and efficiency.

          <p className="mt-2 text-center text-gray-600">
            As a Fullstack Developer & Business Analyst Intern, I was
            responsible for leading several technical projects that directly
            impacted the company's efficiency. My work involved revamping the
            website using React.js and Node.js, optimizing database performance,
            and developing business software for automating payroll and delivery
            route management. I also worked closely with stakeholders to gather
            business requirements and ensure the successful execution of these
            projects.

            One of the biggest challenges I faced during this internship was
            managing multiple projects simultaneously. I applied agile
            methodologies and effective project management strategies to ensure
            each project was completed on time. Through these challenges, I
            significantly enhanced my skills in fullstack development,
            particularly in React.js, and improved my problem-solving abilities
            in database management.
